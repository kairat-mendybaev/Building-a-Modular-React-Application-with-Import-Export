Component Details

The application is structured into several React components, managed through modularity principles:

Header and Footer Components:
Located in Header.js and Footer.js respectively.
Each is exported as a default export from their files.
ContentA and ContentB Components:
Contain dummy content to demonstrate functionality.
Exported using named exports from ContentA.js and ContentB.js.
Button Component:
A shared component used in both content components for demonstrating shared functionality.
Exported using a named export from SharedComponents.js.
Importing Components in App.js

Default Imports: Used for Header and Footer components.
Named Imports: Used for ContentA, ContentB, and the Button component.
Directory Structure

src/
components/ - Contains all the component files.
App.js - Main application component that imports and uses the modular components.
index.js - Entry point for the React application.
